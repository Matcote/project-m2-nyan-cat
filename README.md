# Path to Enlightenment Javascript Game

Play the game!! ---> https://pathtoenlightenment.netlify.app/

This is a game where the goal is to dodge your thoughts, and get to 100%. There are two difficulties: Student and Sensei. Upon reaching 100%, there is a suprise waiting for you ðŸ˜‰.

This is my first project done using Javascript. The game was made over the course of ~3 days. I used sounds from freesound.org and found all the images online, except the thought bubbles which i customized myself.

Have fun!!!
